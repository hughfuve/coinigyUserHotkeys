This extends chrome to allow custom user hotkeys for Coinigy.com the amazing multi crypto exchange charting service.

Need someone to make custom hotkey's and mods for you? Message me direct, or email at hughfuve@gmail.com 
Pay with Bitcoin, custom work $100 per hour, something like this would cost about $500.

CUSTOM USER HOTKEYS FOR COINIGY

This example ..turns CTRL 1,2,3,4,6,7 into quick sets for the sell prices..

CTRL + 1 resets to base prices
CTRL+  2 sets to half the available stock , then doubles the sell price .. successive hits doubles the sell price again and again.
CTRL+  3 sets to half the available stock , then triples the sell price .. successive hits triple the sell price again and again.
CTRL+  4 sets to half the available stock , then quads the sell price .. successive hits quad the sell price again and again.

CTRL+  6 does a fib/golden ratio level sell, and sets to available stock/1.66 and then sets the sell price to price *1.66, successive hits raise the price by golden ratio *1.66
CTRL+  7 sets to available stock/2 then sets the sell price to price *1.75, why this value? I dont know just testing...
