CUSTOM USER HOTKEYS FOR COINIGY

This example ..turns CTRL 1,2,3,4,6,7 into quick sets for the sell prices..

CTRL + 1 resets to base prices
CTRL+  2 sets to half the available stock , then doubles the sell price .. successive hits doubles the sell price again and again.
CTRL+  3 sets to half the available stock , then triples the sell price .. successive hits triple the sell price again and again.
CTRL+  4 sets to half the available stock , then quads the sell price .. successive hits quad the sell price again and again.

CTRL+  6 does a fib/golden ratio level sell, and sets to available stock/1.66 and then sets the sell price to price *1.66, successive hits raise the price by golden ratio *1.66
CTRL+  7 sets to available stock/2 then sets the sell price to price *1.75, why this value? I dont know just testing...
